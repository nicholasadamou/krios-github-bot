## ü§î What is '_Krios_'?

This project was developed as part of the _IBM Developer JumpStart 2020 Slam_ event, where IBM software engineers in groups of 4 - 5 are matched with a senior level engineer who is working on a real problem for their respective department as well as a design coach.

The **goal** is to develop a **proof of concept** solution to the given issue presented by the groups' stakeholders (the senior level engineer).

Each group has to work together with their stakeholders and design coach to plan, organize, develop, and finally present their P.O.C. to other stakeholders at the _Slam 2_ event that takes places 3.5 months from the first slam.

üèÜ Winner of the _IBM Developer JumpStart Slam 2021 People's Choice Award_ for overall best Proof of Concept and Presentation.

## But, really, what is '_Krios_'?

This question is answered in the **rational** section of [bot/README](bot/README.md).

**Fun fact** üöÄ: _Krios_ is the code name for the project. It was named after the Greek titan _Crius_. For artistic effect, we dropped the 'C' and added a 'K'. It also follows the tradition that developers have with giving their projects code names. For example, Windows XP was code named _Whistler_, Windows 95 was code named _Chicago_, for example. We just thought it would be super cool to name it after a Greek titan instead of use a city name.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Please visit the **installation** section found in [bot/README](bot/README.md) to get the Krios GitHub Bot up and running.

## Resources?

Yes, other resources, such as our final presentation, our user interview script and debrief, problem statement and proposal, and much more all exist in [resources](resources/).

## [API](api/)?

This project started as the backend to [bot](bot/). However, given the time-constraints of the project, this was abandoned for now until more time could be alloted into it. Majority of the functionality is contained within [bot](bot/) and should be moved into [api](api/) at a later date.

## üéâ Acknowledgments

    - Thank you to our stakeholder's and design coach.
    - A big thank you to IBM and the organizers of the IBM Developer JumpStart Slam event!
