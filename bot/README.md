# Krios GitHub Bot ðŸ¤–

## Rationale

This package's intent is to automatically create pull requests after a version of given lib is updated. Each PR will be created in a repo which depends on the package which has been updated and will suggest to merge a modified `package.json` or `requirements.txt` file based on the passed Bill of Actions.

4. [Create a GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/) and obtain its credentials (e.g. `PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_APP_IDENTIFIER`, etc). Install the bot onto a specific repository.
